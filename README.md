# Programming-Problems-Solutions
This repo contains my solutions of coding challenges of different online judges (mostly [uvaonlinjudge](https://onlinejudge.org/)). I moved them here from [Virtual Judge](https://vjudge.net/). My profile [there](https://vjudge.net/user/imran_pavel#). If you have an account there you can check my stuffs there as well in this [link](https://vjudge.net/status/#un=imran_pavel&OJId=All&probNum=&res=1&orderBy=run_id&language=) (without an account you can only see stats. After logging in you can see the solution once you click the language (e.g. C++) for a particular submission).
